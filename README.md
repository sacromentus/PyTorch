PyTorch Project Overview

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts demonstrating the use of PyTorch for various machine learning tasks. The projects range from basic implementations of neural network concepts to more complex applications, including image recognition and data visualization with TensorBoard.
Contents

    basic_nn.py: An introductory script implementing a simple neural network.
    image_recognition.py: A script for image recognition tasks using custom and pretrained models.
    tensorboard_visualization.py: Demonstrates the use of TensorBoard for visualizing model architecture and performance.

Installation
Prerequisites

    Python 3.x
    PyTorch
    TorchVision
    TensorBoard (for visualization)

Setup

    Clone the repository:

    bash

git clone (https://github.com/sacromentus/PyTorch)

Navigate to the repository directory:

bash

cd PyTorch

Install the required Python packages (it is recommended to use a virtual environment):

    pip install torch torchvision tensorboard

Usage
Basic Neural Network

To run the basic neural network example:

python basic_nn.py

Image Recognition

To execute the image recognition script:

python image_recognition.py

TensorBoard Visualization

To visualize the models and training metrics in TensorBoard:

python tensorboard_visualization.py

After running the script, launch TensorBoard using the following command:

css

tensorboard --logdir=runs

Then, open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:6006/ to view the visualizations.
